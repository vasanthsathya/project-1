â¦¾ **Why are Omnia containers not coming up after rebooting the OIM?**

**Probable Cause**: The Admin NIC on the OIM may have its autoconnect settings disabled (``autoconnect=no``), which stops it from reconnecting automatically after a reboot.

**Resolution**: Ensure that the Admin NIC on the OIM is configured with ``autoconnect=yes`` so it automatically reconnects after reboot. If you changed this configuration, reboot your OIM once to nullify any cache-related or stale configuration issues.
