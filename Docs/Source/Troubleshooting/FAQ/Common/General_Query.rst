**Resolution**: Re-run the failed playbook once the issue is resolved.

⦾ **What are the licenses required when deploying a cluster through Omnia?**

**Resolution**: While Omnia playbooks are licensed by Apache 2.0, Omnia deploys multiple software that are licensed separately by their respective developer communities.
