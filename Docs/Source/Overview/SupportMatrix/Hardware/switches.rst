    * The switches that have reached EOL might not function properly. We recommended using switch models mentioned in the support matrix.

    * Omnia requires OS10 to be installed on ethernet switches.

    * Omnia requires MLNX-OS to be installed on Infiniband switches.

    * Ethernet switches running SONiC OS will have to be configured manually by users.
