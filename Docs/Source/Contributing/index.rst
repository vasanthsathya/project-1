Contributing To Omnia
======================

We encourage everyone to help us improve Omnia by contributing to the project. Contributions can be as small as documentation updates or adding example use cases, to adding commenting and properly styling code segments all the way up to full feature contributions. We ask that contributors follow our established guidelines for contributing to the project.

This document will evolve as the project matures. Please be sure to regularly refer back in order to stay in-line with contribution guidelines.
