Configure additional NICs and specify Kernel Parameters on the nodes
=======================================================================

Omnia provides two methods for configuring additional NICs and defining Kernel command-line parameters on the nodes:

1. You can run the ``server_spec_update.yml`` playbook separately after the ``discovery_provision.yml`` playbook has been executed and the nodes have booted up. In this case, you need to add the necessary inputs to the ``input/network_spec.yml`` and ``input/server_spec.yml`` and then run the ``server_spec_update.yml`` playbook.
2. [Optional] Alternatively, you can configure these settings during the cluster provisioning process itself (before the nodes have booted up). To do so, add the necessary inputs to the ``input/network_spec.yml`` and ``input/server_spec.yml`` files, and then run the ``discovery_provision.yml`` playbook. For more details on configuring these during provisioning, `click here <../RHEL_new/Provision/installprovisiontool.html#optional-additional-configurations-handled-by-the-provision-tool>`_.

.. note:: To know more about the supported kernel command-line parameters, `click here <https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html>`_.

**Playbook objectives**

The ``server_spec_update.yml`` playbook can be used to do the following tasks:

    * Configure additional NICs.
    * Configure OS Kernel command-line parameters on the nodes.
    * Configure additional NICs and OS kernel command-line parameters on the nodes.

**Prerequisites**

* All target nodes are provisioned and booted. `Click here <../RHEL_new/Provision/ViewingDB.html>`_ to know how to verify the status of the nodes.

* Ensure that ``input/network_spec.yml`` file has been updated with all network information in addition to ``admin_network`` and ``bmc_network`` information. Below are all applicable properties of an additional network:

    * ``nic_name``: The name of the NIC on which the administrative network is accessible to the OIM.
    * ``netmask_bits``: The 32-bit "mask" used to divide an IP address into subnets and specify the network's available hosts.
    * ``static_range``: The static range of IPs to be provisioned on target nodes. This indicates that only a certain static range is available to Omnia.
    * ``network_gateway``: The gateway through which the NIC is connected to the switch.

* In addition to the above mentioned properties, the following properties are also applicable and can be added in ``input/network_spec.yml`` for additional NICs:

    * ``CIDR``: Classless or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addresses use variable length subnet masking (VLSM) to alter the ratio between the network and host address bits in an IP address.

      .. note:: You can either use ``CIDR`` or ``static_range``. Simultaneous use of both parameters will result in an error message being displayed.

    * ``MTU``: Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is a measurement in bytes of the largest data packets that an Internet-connected device can accept. Default value of ``MTU`` is 1500. You can enter your desired value.
    * ``VLAN``: A 12-bit field that identifies a virtual LAN (VLAN) and specifies the VLAN that an ethernet frame belongs to.

* Modify the ``input/server_spec.yml`` file with the additional NIC information and/or OS command-line kernel parameters that you want to add or alter for the target nodes. Ensure the following:

    * ``Categories``: All NICs listed in the ``server_spec.yml`` file are grouped into categories (groups for servers). The field ``Categories`` should not be edited out of the ``input/server_spec.yml`` file.
    * The name of the NIC specified in the file (in the below sample, ``ensp0``, ``ensp0.5``, and ``eno1``) is the unique identifier of NICs in the file.
    * ``nictype``: The property ``nictype`` indicates what kind of NIC is in use (ethernet, infiniband, or vlan). If the ``nictype`` is set to ``vlan``, ensure to specify a primary NIC for the VLAN using the property ``nicdevices``.
    * ``cmdline``: The OS Kernel command-line parameters should be provided under ``cmdline`` field. If you want to provide multiple kernel parameters, ensure that they are separated by a "space".

.. note::

    * If a ``static_range`` value is provided in ``input/network_spec.yml``, additional networks are not correlated.
    * If a ``CIDR`` value is provided in ``input/network_spec.yml``, the complete subnet is used for Omnia to assign IPs and where possible, the IPs will be correlated with the assignment on the admin network. Omnia performs correlation for additional networks if the subnet prefix for the admin network is a superset, and the additional network is a subset. For example, if the subnet prefix for the admin network is */16* and for the additional network it's */24*, Omnia attempts to correlate the IPs if the value for the ``correlate_to_admin`` field is set to true in ``input/network_spec.yml``.
    * If a VLAN is required, ensure that a VLAN ID is provided in the ``vlan`` field in ``input/server_spec.yml`` and ensure that it's provided in the ``NIC.vlan_id`` format. For example, consider "eth1.101" where ``eth1`` is the NIC name configured with a VLAN is and ``101`` is the ``vlan_id``. This field is not supported on admin or bmc networks.
    * While new networks can be added to the ``network_spec.yml`` file on subsequent runs of the ``server_spec_update.yml`` playbook, existing networks cannot be edited or deleted. If the user modifies or removes existing networks from ``input/network_spec.yml``, the playbook execution might fail. In that case, the user needs to `reprovision the node <../Maintenance/reprovision.html>`_.

**Usage Instructions**

* *To configure additional NICs, do the following:*

    1. Fill up all the necessary details for the additional NICs in the ``input/network_spec.yml`` file. You can refer the following sample: ::

        - nic_network1:
           netmask_bits: "24"
           CIDR: "10.23.1.0"
           network_gateway: "10.23.1.0"
           MTU: "1500"
           VLAN: ""
        - nic_network2:
           netmask_bits: "24"
           static_range: "10.23.2.1-10.23.2.254"
           network_gateway: "10.23.2.0"
           MTU: "1500"
           VLAN: "1"

    2. Add the additional NIC information to the ``input/server_spec.yml`` file. You can refer the following sample: ::

        Categories:
          - category-1:
              - network:
                  - ensp0:
                      nicnetwork: "nic_network1"
                      nictypes: "ethernet"
                  - ensp0.5:
                      nicnetwork: "nic_network2"
                      nictypes: "vlan"
                      nicdevices: "ensp0"


* *To configure OS Kernel command-line parameters on the nodes, do the following:*

    1. Do not change anything in the ``input/network_spec.yml`` file.

    2. Add the OS Kernel command-line parameters to the ``cmdline`` field in the ``input/server_spec.yml`` file. You can refer the following sample: ::

        Categories:
           - category-1:
               - os:
                   - kernel:
                       - cmdline: "iommu=pt intel_iommu=off pci=realloc=off processor.max_cstate=0 intel_idle.max_cstate=0 intel_pstate=disable"



* *To configure additional NICs and specify OS Kernel command-line parameters on the nodes, do the following:*

    1. Fill up all the necessary details for the additional NICs in the ``input/network_spec.yml`` file. You can refer the following sample: ::

        - nic_network1:
           netmask_bits: "24"
           CIDR: "10.23.1.0"
           network_gateway: "10.23.1.0"
           MTU: "1500"
           VLAN: ""
        - nic_network2:
           netmask_bits: "24"
           static_range: "10.23.2.1-10.23.2.254"
           network_gateway: "10.23.2.0"
           MTU: "1500"
           VLAN: "1"

    2. Add the OS Kernel command-line parameters to the ``cmdline`` field in the ``input/server_spec.yml`` file. You can refer the following sample: ::

        Categories:
          - category-1:
              - network:
                  - ensp0:
                      nicnetwork: "nic_network1"
                      nictypes: "ethernet"
                  - ensp0.5:
                      nicnetwork: "nic_network2"
                      nictypes: "vlan"
                      nicdevices: "ensp0"
              - os:
                  - kernel:
                      - cmdline: "iommu=pt intel_iommu=off pci=realloc=off processor.max_cstate=0 intel_idle.max_cstate=0 intel_pstate=disable"

.. note::

    * If OS Kernel command-line parameter configuration is not required on the nodes, the user can leave the ``cmdine`` entry empty in ``input/server_spec.yml`` or remove the ``os`` section.
    * The ``nicnetwork`` details must be consistent with the network names specified in the ``input/network_spec.yml`` file.
    * While new groups can be added to the ``input/server_spec.yml`` file on subsequent runs of the ``server_spec_update.yml`` playbook, existing groups cannot be edited or deleted. If the user modifies or removes existing groups from ``input/server_spec.yml``, the playbook execution might fail. In that case, the user needs to `reprovision the node <../Maintenance/reprovision.html>`_.
    * This playbook has been validated with the following Kernel parameters:

            * iommu=pt
            * intel_iommu=off
            * pci=realloc=off
            * processor.max_cstate=0
            * intel_idle.max_cstate=0
            * intel_pstate=disable

.. caution::

    * If duplicate entries of the same command line parameter is provided but with different values, then the playbook picks up to the last provided value overwriting any previous entries. For example, if the user provides ``"intel_iommu=on intel_iommu=off"`` as the parameters, the configuration will ultimately be set to ``"intel_iommu=off"``, as this is the last value provided.
    * Similarly, if the ``server_spec_update.yml`` playbook is executed with a command line parameter, such as ``"intel_iommu=off"``, and is later rerun with the same parameter but an updated value, such as ``"intel_iommu=on"``, the playbook will assign the latest value for that parameter. As a result, it will ultimately set ``"intel_iommu=on"`` for the configuration. This behavior ensures that the most recent configuration is applied during execution.

**Executing the playbook**

After you have filled up the ``input/network_spec.yml`` and ``input/server_spec.yml`` with all the necessary details based on the configuration(s) required, do the following to execute the playbook:

* First, create an inventory while referencing the sample inventory format is present in ``examples/server_spec_inv`` and also attached below: ::

    #---------Template1---------
    [cluster1]
    10.5.0.1
    10.5.0.2
    [cluster1:vars]
    Categories=category-1

    #---------Template2---------
    [cluster2]
    10.5.0.5 Categories=category-4
    10.5.0.6 Categories=category-5

    #---------Template3---------
    10.5.0.3 Categories=category-2
    10.5.0.4 Categories=category-3

In the above sample inventory file, ``[cluster1]`` and ``[cluster2]`` are user-defined groups with servers associated to them. The group ``[cluster1]`` is mapped and categorised under ``[<group name>:vars]``. Nodes in the ``[cluster2]`` group or any ungrouped nodes are directly mapped to their respective ``Categories``.

.. note:: While creating the inventory file, ensure that each group has unique nodes. One node should not be part of two groups.

* Finally, use the below command to execute the playbook: ::

    cd utils/server_spec_update
    ansible-playbook server_spec_update.yml -i <inventory_file_path>

.. caution:: Omnia does not support modifying the category definitions (for example, ``nic_name``, ``nicnetwork``, or ``nictype``) in ``input/server_spec.yml`` or changing the category details in the inventory file provided, during consecutive runs of the ``server_spec_update.yml`` playbook.

Based on the provided sample files, server 10.5.0.1 has been mapped to ``[cluster1]`` which corresponds to **category-1**. Therefore, the NICs ensp0 and ensp0.5 will be configured in an ethernet VLAN group with ensp0 as the primary device.
