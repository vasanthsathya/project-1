Step 7: Create local repositories for the cluster
==================================================

The ``local_repo.yml`` playbook, invoked from inside the ``omnia_core`` container, downloads all the software packages to the Pulp container and facilitates Airgap installation (without access to public network) on the cluster nodes. The **Pulp container**, set up on an NFS share, acts as a centralized storage unit and hosts all software packages and images required and supported by Omnia. These packages or images are then accessed by the cluster nodes from that NFS share.

Once the Pulp container is ready, you can provide inputs to the ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/software_config.json`` and ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/local_repo_config.yml`` files, based on which the desired packages or images will be accessed from the container and downloaded onto the cluster nodes (without Internet access).
