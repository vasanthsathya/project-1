BeeGFS bolt on
--------------

BeeGFS is a hardware-independent POSIX parallel file system (a.k.a. Software-defined Parallel Storage) developed with a strong focus on performance and designed for ease of use, simple installation, and management.

**Pre Requisites before installing BeeGFS client**

* Ensure that the BeeGFS server is set up using the `linked steps <../../../../../Appendices/BeeGFSServer.html>`_.
* Ensure that a ``connAuthFile`` is configured on the server as explained `here <../../../../../Appendices/BeeGFSServer.html>`_

.. caution:: Configuring a ``connAuthFile`` is now mandatory. Services will no longer start if a ``connAuthFile`` is not configured

* Ensure that the following ports are open for TCP and UDP connectivity:

        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | Port | Service                           |
        +======+===================================+
        | 8008 | Management service (beegfs-mgmtd) |
        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | 8003 | Storage service (beegfs-storage)  |
        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | 8004 | Client service (beegfs-client)    |
        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | 8005 | Metadata service (beegfs-meta)    |
        +------+-----------------------------------+
        | 8006 | Helper service (beegfs-helperd)   |
        +------+-----------------------------------+

 To open the ports required, use the following steps:

    1. ``firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=<port number>/tcp``

    2. ``firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=<port number>/udp``

    3. ``firewall-cmd --reload``

    4. ``systemctl status firewalld``

.. note:: BeeGFS services over RDMA is only supported on RHEL 8.3 and above due to limitations on BeeGFS. When setting up your cluster with RDMA support, check the BeeGFS documentation to provide appropriate values in ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/storage_config.yml``.

**Installing the BeeGFS client via Omnia**

After the required parameters are filled in ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/storage_config.yml``, Omnia installs BeeGFS on all nodes while executing the ``storage.yml`` playbook.

.. caution:: Do not remove or comment any lines in the ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/storage_config.yml`` file.

.. note::
    * BeeGFS client-server communication can take place over TCP or RDMA. If RDMA support is required, set ``beegfs_rdma_support`` should be set to true. Also, OFED should be installed on all cluster nodes.
    * For BeeGFS communication happening over RDMA, the ``beegfs_mgmt_server`` should be provided with the Infiniband IP of the management server.
    * The parameter inventory refers to the `inventory file <../../../../samplefiles.html>`_ listing all relevant nodes.

If ``/opt/omnia/input/project_default/storage_config.yml`` is populated before running ``omnia.yml``, BeeGFS client will be set up during the execution of ``omnia.yml``.

If ``omnia.yml`` is not leveraged to set up BeeGFS, execute the ``storage.yml`` playbook : ::

    cd storage
    ansible-playbook storage.yml -i inventory
